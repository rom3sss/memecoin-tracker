## Memecoin Alpha & Hype Tracker Bot
üìñ Overview
This high-speed, automated Python script is designed to monitor a curated list of influential X (formerly Twitter) accounts to detect early mentions of new memecoins. The primary goal is to identify potential launches on platforms like pump.fun and quantify social media hype in real-time. By automating the discovery process, the bot aims to provide a significant informational edge in the fast-paced memecoin market.

The bot parses tweets for high-priority signals such as contract addresses (CAs) and launchpad links. Once a potential coin is identified, it immediately measures its "Hype Velocity" by tracking mentions across X, and logs all actionable data to a Google Sheet for quick analysis and decision-making.

## Features
Influencer Monitoring: Continuously monitors the timelines of a specified list of X usernames from a Google Sheet.

Multi-Signal Detection: Scans tweets with a prioritized approach:

Contract Addresses (CA): Directly parses for ETH, BASE, and SOL contract addresses.

Launchpad Links: Automatically identifies and extracts CAs from pump.fun links.

Keywords & Cashtags: Detects memecoin slang (send it, 1000x, $WIF) to catch early signals.

Real-Time Hype Tracking: Upon detection, the bot immediately queries the X API to calculate the number of unique users mentioning the coin within critical timeframes (15 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours).

Automated Data Logging: All findings are structured and exported in real-time to a dedicated Google Sheet, providing a clean dashboard for analysis.

Robust & Resilient: Includes error handling and retry logic to ensure continuous operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Initialization: The script authenticates with the X API v2 and the Google Sheets API using your provided credentials.

Load Targets: It fetches the list of target X usernames from your designated 'Target Accounts' Google Sheet.

Timeline Polling: The bot enters a continuous loop, fetching the most recent tweets from each target account's timeline.

Signal Parsing: Each new tweet is scanned by the parse_tweet_for_alpha function. It aggressively searches for contract addresses, pump.fun links, or a combination of keywords and new cashtags.

Hype Calculation: If a valid signal (like a CA) is found, the calculate_hype_velocity function is triggered. It performs a search on X for the coin's CA to count recent unique mentions.

Data Output: The collected data‚Äîincluding the CA, source account, detection time, hype metrics, and a link to the source tweet‚Äîis formatted and inserted as a new row in your 'Memecoin Alpha' Google Sheet.

Loop & Repeat: The script waits for a configured interval (e.g., 60 seconds) before repeating the process to check for new tweets, ensuring it stays up-to-date while respecting API rate limits.

## üöÄ Setup and Usage
For a detailed, step-by-step guide on acquiring API keys and configuring your environment, please refer to the Setup Guide provided with the script. The basic steps are:

## Prerequisites: Install Python 3.8+ and the required libraries:

pip install tweepy pandas gspread oauth2client

## API Keys:

Obtain a Bearer Token from the X Developer Portal.

Set up a Google Cloud Project, enable the Google Drive & Sheets APIs, and download the JSON credentials for a service account.

## Google Sheets Setup:

Create two sheets: one for input (Target Accounts) and one for output (Memecoin Alpha).

Share both sheets with the client_email found in your Google JSON credentials file, granting it "Editor" permissions.

## Configure the Script:

Edit the memecoin_tracker.py file and fill in the following variables:

X_BEARER_TOKEN

GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDS_FILE (the path to your JSON file)

INPUT_SHEET_NAME

OUTPUT_SHEET_NAME

## Run the Bot:

python memecoin_tracker.py
